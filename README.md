# poersonal-portfolio
This project is a basic portfolio for web desinger and web developer to showcase their work.
I got an inspiration of this project from [Personal: HTML5 website template](http://buckymaler.com/featured-work/personal).
And I decided to extend this project by building a dynamic website based on Dajngo framework and created a full function of 
CRUD blog post which you can create, read, update and delete.
