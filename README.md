# poersonal-portfolio
This project is a basic portfolio for web desinger and web developer to showcase their work.
I got an inspiration of this project from [Personal: HTML5 website template](http://buckymaler.com/featured-work/personal).
And I decided to extend this project by building a dynamic buuild website based on Dajngo framework and created a full functio of 
blog post which you can create, read, update and delete similair to twtitter.
